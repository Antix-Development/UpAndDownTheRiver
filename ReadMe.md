### About

Up and Down the River is a single page web application created to keep score when playing the card game Up and Down the River.

Up and Down the River mostly exists because I'm so terribly inept at scoring with pen and paper :D

Up and Down the River has been mashed into a single file because it refuses to function on my Android tablet when it is split into its component parts (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

Up and Down the River has been tested working in Firefox and Chrome on Windows10, your mileage may vary with other browsers and operating systems.

Anyway, if you have any questions or suggestions just raise an issue.
